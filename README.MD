# ZZKPNEWS - Project and Coding Styles

## Introduction

At present, this project is equipped with three style guides: a stylized document template, reference style resources, and a project checklist. Drawing on a variety of other resources, and based on the business model and specific needs of Zhongyuan Science and Technology Network, these guides have been modified, supplemented, and trimmed to create a designated style guide for use in guiding individual tasks or team collaborations on software projects for Zhongyuan Science and Technology Network, providing a systematic standard for development work.
